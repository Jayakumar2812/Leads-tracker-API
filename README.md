# Leads-tracker-API
This is an simple API to store the websites(URL)  you visit using a single click as I found it annoying to remember the some great websites which i visted. 
<br>
Configurations are simple you add it as an extension and you are good to go.
<br>
Use cases:
* HR's would love to save the linkedln profile with a single click and get back to it later when necessary.
* Saving any websites which you know you would need it later.
